 *
 * There is no unique index to lean on yet — legacy-imported rows may already
 * repeat, so it would fail to build (the same expand/contract as the
 * students' national_id, CLAUDE.md §1). The advisory lock stands in for it:
 * two submits with the same method and number serialize on it until the
 * first one commits, so the second one's lookup sees the first one's row.
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock` releases itself with the transaction.

 * Every payment counts, whatever its status: a rejected payment's operation
 * was still spent, and a replacement receipt for the same payment is a new
 * `payment_receipts` row, not a new payment.
