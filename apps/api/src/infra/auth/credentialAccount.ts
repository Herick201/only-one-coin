 * a "user" row, and a credential "account" row whose `accountId` is the user
 * id and whose `issuer` is `createLocalAccountIssuer("credential")` — the
 * pair sign-in looks the password up by (sign-in.mjs).
 *
 * The e-mail is stored lower-cased, as sign-in lower-cases before looking up.
 * `role` is written directly: it is `input:false` towards the client, and this
 * never runs on a client's behalf.
