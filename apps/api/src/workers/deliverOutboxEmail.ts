 *
 * - `skipped` — the row is gone or already reached an end state (a job that
 *   ran twice, a relay that offered it again). Nothing is sent twice.
 * - `blocked` — the allowlist guard refused the recipient outside production
 *   (CLAUDE.md §6). A decision, not a failure: never retried.
 * - `failed`  — the provider said no for good (4xx), the template could not
 *   render, or the last retry was spent.
