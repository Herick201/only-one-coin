/**
 * The one place a feature flag is declared.
 *
 * A flag answers a single question: does this piece of the platform exist in
 * production, or is it still ours alone? Off does not mean "gone" — it means
 * the screen is served to nobody but us, and reaching it in production takes
 * the internal unlock (`preview.ts`). Local and Vercel preview deploys are our
 * ground: every flag is on there, always, so a branch never demos half a panel.
 *
 * Two rules keep this honest:
 *
 * 1. A new section is born `production: false`. Whoever ships it flips the flag
 *    the day the section is real, in the same PR that makes it real — nothing
 *    reaches a student because someone forgot a file existed.
 * 2. The flag is not the access control. What a person may *do* is the role
 *    check declared on the route in `apps/api` (CLAUDE.md §8). A flag decides
 *    whether the feature is on the air at all; the role decides who it answers.
