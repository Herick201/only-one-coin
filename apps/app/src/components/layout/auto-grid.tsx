/**
 * Grid that fits as many columns of at least `min` as the space it lands in —
 * with no breakpoint involved.
 *
 * Every `sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4` is a guess about the viewport, and a
 * screen inside a shell never gets the viewport: the backoffice sidebar takes
 * 13.5rem open and 3rem collapsed, the portal's takes 16rem, and the content
 * column is capped on top of that. One window width therefore means several
 * different columns, which is why a screen can look right on the monitor it
 * was built on and break two seats over.
 *
 * `auto-fit` asks the browser the only question that matters — how many of
 * these still fit here — and answers it again on every resize, on every
 * sidebar toggle, and on a monitor nobody has tested on yet.
 *
 * `min(…, 100%)` is the floor guard: without it a container narrower than
 * `min` overflows instead of dropping to a single column.
 *
 * New screens: reach for this before writing a `grid-cols-*` breakpoint.
