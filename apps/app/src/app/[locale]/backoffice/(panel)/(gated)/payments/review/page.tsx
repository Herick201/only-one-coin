/**
 * The human review queue in full — what the home card previews. Every payment
 * still owed a decision ends here: the open enrollment is finished by approving
 * it, and its seat goes back to the class group by rejecting it.
 *
 * Search and paging live in the URL and run in Postgres
 * (`GET /api/v1/payments/review`, oldest first): this server component reads
 * them from `searchParams` and fetches exactly the page asked for. The client
 * component only rewrites the URL and sends the decisions.
 *
 * `?receipt=` names one of them. It is how the other screens hand a specific
 * case over — the ledger's payment dialog — instead of leaving the reader to
 * find in the queue the row they were already looking at. An id that is not on
 * the loaded page just opens the queue: a stale link is not an error page.
